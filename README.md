# libft
This project involved building a lightweight C library that replicates the functionality of common standard functions and includes a set of custom additions


Libft is the first major project at 42 School designed to strengthen foundational C programming skills by building a custom library from scratch. The goal is to recreate commonly used standard library functions (libc) and implement additional utility functions that will be useful in later projects. This library is written entirely in C and compiled into a static library (libft.a) that can be reused throughout the 42 curriculum.

By completing Libft, students will:
	•	Gain in-depth understanding of how low-level standard C functions work by reimplementing them.
	•	Practice manual memory management, including allocation and freeing, while avoiding leaks or segmentation faults.
	•	Improve code organization, modularity, and scope handling (e.g., through static functions).
	•	Write robust and clean C code in compliance with strict coding standards (Norme).
	•	Use and understand function pointers, especially when working with strings and linked lists.
	•	Learn to create and manage a custom linked list data structure.
	•	Gain experience in writing and using a Makefile for compiling a project and its library.
